# guardian-stone-device

This is a side project I put together to provide a sort of 'pager duty' alert system when a wheel-chair bound friend falls out of his char.

It uses the Particle Electron 3G-enabled microcontroller with GPS Shield to track his location in real-time and publish his location to a list of care-givers and family members with his current location if he ever falls out of his chair.

Note: 
This is my first time writing C code and is a very rough work-in-progress. As such it *should not be construed as a reflection of my best work*.
