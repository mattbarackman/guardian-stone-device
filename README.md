# guardian-stone-device

This is a side project I'm developing to provide a sort of 'pager duty' sms-based alert system that will notify family members when and where a wheel-chair bound friend has fallen from his chair.

It uses a Particle Electron 3G-enabled microcontroller with GPS Shield to track his location in real-time and detect if he is in his chair.

It will also allow him to use an associated [web app](https://github.com/mattbarackman/guardian-stone-app) to turn the device on and off via his smartphone and check the battery level of the device.

Note: 
This is my first time writing C code and is a very rough work-in-progress. As such it *should not be construed as a reflection of my best work*.
